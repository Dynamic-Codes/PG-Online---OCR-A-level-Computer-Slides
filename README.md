# All OCR PG-Online Slides

This is a github repo that aims to provide free revision material for Computer Science. We have kindly got the PG-Online A Level slides for the OCR Exam Board collected here in 1 spot!



## Prerequisites

You will first be required to download **7zip**. 7-Zip is a free and open-source file archiver, a utility used to place groups of files within compressed containers known as "archives"

To install 7zip, follow these steps:
- Go to [Downloads Page](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) for 7zip
- Install the correct file for your operating system
- Run the installer and complete the setup


## Getting The Slides

1. Go ahead and clone the repo by selecting `<> Code` ‚û°Ô∏è `Local` ‚û°Ô∏è   `Download ZIP`.

2. This should go ahead and download a zip file named `PG-Online-OCR-A-level-Computer-Slides-main.zip` to your download location. Extract the ZIP file and head into the following directory:
```sh
PG-Online-OCR-A-level-Computer-Slides-main\All Slides
```
3. You should find a file called `AllSlidesZipSplit.zip.001`. Double click on it to open it. This should open the 7zip GUI. From there combine and extract all of the powerpoints by selecting `Extract` ‚û°Ô∏è`OK`.

4. Finally you can close out of 7zip when the process is complete and in the same directory you can find a folder called `OCR Computer Science Slides`.

üéâEnjoy the Slides!
